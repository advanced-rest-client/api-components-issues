# Api Components issues

A repository to file common issues to all API Components.

If you find a bug in an application that has been build with API Components but you are not sure which component specifically is responsible for unwanted behavior then use this repository to report this issue.

It is also OK to file an issue in application's project page. The issues from here and corresponding applications will be distributed accordingly.
